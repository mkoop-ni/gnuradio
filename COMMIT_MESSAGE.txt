cmake: Add multi-package-manager support for Conan and native builds

This commit introduces toolchain detection to support both Conan and
native package managers (MinGW, vcpkg, system packages), resolving
build configuration issues when using different C++ package management
workflows on Windows and Linux.

Key changes:

1. GrPython.cmake:
   - Add automatic Conan toolchain detection via CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
   - Introduce REL_PYTHON_INSTALL_PATH and REL_PYTHON_INSTALL_LIB_PATH
     variables that adapt to the detected package manager
   - For Conan: use python<version>/ and python<version>/Lib/site-packages
   - For native builds: use bin/ and lib/python<version>/site-packages
   - Make GR_PYTHON_DIR configurable and toolchain-aware

2. setup-gtk.cmake:
   - Update GTK paths to use the new REL_PYTHON_INSTALL_LIB_PATH variable
   - Set default GTK_BIN_DIR to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin instead of
     hardcoded C:/gtk-build path
   - Add diagnostic messages for path configuration

3. gr-fft/CMakeLists.txt:
   - Fix FFTW package name case sensitivity (FFTW3f vs FFTW3)
   - Conan builds use FFTW3, native builds use FFTW3f

4. gr-qtgui/CMakeLists.txt:
   - Handle QWT package name differences between package managers
   - Conan uses 'qwt', native builds use 'Qwt'
   - Support both package name variants

This change enables GNU Radio to build correctly across different
development environments without manual CMake configuration adjustments,
improving the cross-platform and cross-toolchain build experience.
