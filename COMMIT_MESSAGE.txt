cmake: Add multi-package-manager support for Conan and native builds

Introduces toolchain detection to support both Conan and native package
managers (MinGW, vcpkg, system packages), resolving build configuration
issues across Windows and Linux.

Changes:
- GrPython.cmake: Auto-detect Conan toolchain via CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH and
  set Python paths dynamically (REL_PYTHON_INSTALL_PATH/LIB_PATH)
- setup-gtk.cmake: Use dynamic paths, default GTK_BIN_DIR to install prefix
- gr-fft/CMakeLists.txt: Handle FFTW3/FFTW3f package name variations
- gr-qtgui/CMakeLists.txt: Handle qwt/Qwt package name variations

Enables GNU Radio builds across different package managers without
manual CMake configuration adjustments.
